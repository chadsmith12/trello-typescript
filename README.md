# trello-typescript
This project shows a basic trello board created in Vue with TypeScript and Vuetify.

This project is basic but has the basic features of a trello board including:
* Creating new Columns
* Creating new Tasks
* Moving Tasks between Columns
* Moving Columns around
* Save state of the board in local storage

This project was mainly created to show the basics of using the native drag and drop api. The drag and drop api was factored into two seperate basic components which would allow you to use these anywhere that you need drag and drop.
